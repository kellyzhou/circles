# Circles
A little interactive JavaScript project I wanted to do, with animated, randomly colored circles and user input fields. 
HTML5 canvas and JS hit regions

## Can't view the circles? 
Please open in:
* Chrome after visiting _chrome://flags_ and setting **ExperimentalCanvasFeatures** to true
* Firefox after visiting _about:config_ and setting **canvas.hitregions.enabled** to true
