# Circles
An interactive JavaScript project with animated, randomly colored circles and user input fields.
HTML5 canvas and JS hit regions

## Can't view the circles?
Please open in:
* Chrome by first visiting _chrome://flags_ and setting **ExperimentalCanvasFeatures** to true
* Firefox by first visiting _about:config_ and setting **canvas.hitregions.enabled** to true

If you still cannot view the browser window populating with circles after setting either of these settings, please submit an issue.
